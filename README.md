# WINDS-Model-Excel-version

WINDS: Water, Irrigation, Nitrogen, Drainage, and Salinity. Broadly mentioned in the book "Irrigation Systems Design" by Waller and Yitayew (2015).
This is a finite difference agriculture model that simulates multiple types of irrigation experiments for soil moisture, crop evapotranspiration,
depletion, and nitrogen and salinity content.

Distinct features:

An integration of the tipping bucket model and Richards equation. This provides model stability.
Field assessment for multiple soil layers.
Addition of remote sensing component.
